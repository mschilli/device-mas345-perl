NAME
    Device::MAS345 - Reading the Mastech MAS-345 Multimeter

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::MAS345;

      my $mas = Device::MAS345->new( port => "/dev/ttyS0" );

      my($val, $unit, $mode) = $mas->read();

DESCRIPTION
    "Device::MAS345" reads data from a Mastech MAS-345 multimeter connected
    to the computer's serial port.

    This cheap (less than $50) multimeter measures voltage, current,
    temperature, resistance, capacity, and features a serial cable to hook
    it up to a PC.

    Using "Device::MAS345", you can connect to the multimeter and read out
    the currently displayed value, along with the selected mode and a units
    character.

    Reading data returns three values:

      my($val, $unit, $mode) = $mas->read();

    $val is the numeric value displayed on the multimeter (e.g. -0.015),
    $unit holds the measurement unit (e.g. "V") and $mode adds an additional
    mode setting (e.g. "DC").

    On error, "Device::MAS345" throws exceptions. If you want to catch them,
    use "eval {}". The cause for the error can be seen by calling the
    object's "error" message, which returns the string of the last
    exception.

  Debugging
    "Device::MAS345" is "Log::Log4perl"-enabled. To turn on debugging, just
    add

        use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
        Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG);

    at the start of your code.

  Serial Ports
    The constructor can be called without arguments. The optional "ports"
    parameter defaults to "/dev/ttyS0", the first serial port.

  Gotchas
    If you want to run this as a non-root user, make sure that

        ls -l /dev/ttyS0

    (or whatever serial port the multimeter is connected to) is
    read/writeable by the user.

    The multimeter has to be turned on for the connection to succeed.
